# OpenVibely User Guides

OpenVibely turns AI coding into a project-aware command center: pick a project, configure models and agents, plan in chat, run work from the task board, review diffs, and automate the follow-up work that should happen again.

The canonical, published documentation lives at <a href="https://docs.openvibely.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs.openvibely.ai</a>. This directory keeps concise in-repo guides for contributors and local reference.

## App Mental Model

OpenVibely is organized around a selected project. The sidebar project selector changes the context for the main product surfaces.

| App Area | What Users Do There |
|---|---|
| Project selector | Choose the repository/workspace that tasks, chat, memory, workers, schedules, and integrations apply to. |
| Chat | Ask questions, plan changes, attach context, and orchestrate work conversationally. |
| Tasks | Create AI coding tasks, run them, inspect output, review changed files, and follow up. |
| Automations | Build supported graphs from schedules, Tasks and Agents, Native approvals, GitHub actions, and outcomes, then watch current state in the Live graph. |
| Schedule | Put individual project Tasks on a calendar so they run once or repeat. |
| Insights | Use grades, pulse, reflection, and analytics (including token usage, cost, and model breakdowns) to understand activity, history, and trends. |
| System | Configure alerts, models, agents, workers, channels, and personality. |

## Managing Large Collections

Card-based lists for Alerts, Automations, Agents, Skills, Models, Channels, and custom Personalities share the same collection controls. Use search and the filters available for that surface to narrow the current project, choose a sort order, and scroll to load additional results without replacing the page.

When selection is available, enter selection mode, choose individual cards or all loaded cards, and use the bulk delete action. The confirmation dialog states what will be removed; protected or non-manageable entries remain unavailable. Search, filters, and sort state are preserved while the collection refreshes.
